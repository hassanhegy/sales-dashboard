Just completed a comprehensive sales analytics dashboard that brings together multi-dimensional business intelligence across our operations.
Key Highlights:

1,465 total orders processed with 3M in tax revenue
Integrated data model connecting 6 dimensional tables (Products, Territories, Dates, Status, Shipping Methods)
916K in freight costs tracked across territories
Real-time status monitoring across 6 order states

Notable Insights:
📈 Peak performance in 2013 with 708 orders
✅ 80% of orders in healthy status (Approved, In Process, Shipped)
🌍 Balanced territorial distribution with consistent 23K dues across regions
📦 Product portfolio spans 111 categories with granular tracking
The data model leverages a star schema design with a central fact table connected to multiple dimension tables, enabling flexible analysis across time periods, geographies, and product hierarchies.
This project demonstrates how proper data modeling and visualization can turn complex datasets into clear business narratives
